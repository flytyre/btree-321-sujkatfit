inserting n

c x y z
_ _ _ _ _ _
 
i

i is position just before n should be inserted
but position after i is full
so we must shift elements

...


advance the cursor
store x in temp
set list[i] = n

c n y z 
_ _ _ _ _ _ 
  i 
  
  
advance cursor to first empty space

c n y z
_ _ _ _ _ _
        i
		
walk backwards, shifting elements forward
set list[i] = list[i - 1]
do this until i - 1 points to added value (n)

c n y z z
_ _ _ _ _ _
	  i
	  
c n y y z
_ _ _ _ _ _ 
    i
	
now, to finish, set list[i] to temp
c n x y z 
_ _ _ _ _ _ 
    i
